    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Cookie Policy explains how <strong>KidsBox</strong> may use cookies and similar technologies on its website or future versions of the mobile application. While the current version of GameBox does <strong>not</strong> collect personal data or use cookies, we believe in being transparent and prepared for future updates that might include safe analytics or advertising components.</p>

    <h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device by a web browser or mobile platform. They are widely used to make websites and apps work efficiently, to improve user experience, and to provide insights about how services are used.</p>

    <h2>Current Use of Cookies</h2>
    <p>As of today, KidsBox does <strong>not use</strong> cookies or tracking technologies. No personal data or browsing data is collected or stored. All gameplay progress and scores are stored locally on the user’s device.</p>

    <h2>Possible Future Use</h2>
    <p>In future versions, if we add analytics or advertising modules, the app may use cookies or local storage to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Measure app performance and usage patterns (anonymous analytics)</li>
      <li>Deliver family-safe, non-personalized ads</li>
      <li>Remember app preferences or user settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All such future features will comply with international standards such as <strong>GDPR (EU)</strong>, <strong>CCPA (California)</strong>, and <strong>COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
    <p>If KidsBox integrates third-party services (such as Google AdMob or Firebase Analytics), those services may use their own cookies or identifiers according to their privacy policies. GameBox will only use trusted, family-safe services.</p>

    <h2>Managing Cookies</h2>
    <p>You can control or delete cookies through your device or browser settings. If cookies are disabled, some future website or app features may not work as intended, but basic gameplay will remain unaffected.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>KidsBox is designed primarily for children, but also includes some light entertainment for adults. We do not knowingly collect or store any personal data from children. Any future analytics or advertising will be strictly <strong>child-safe</strong> and in compliance with COPPA and applicable local laws.</p>

    <h2>Updates to this Policy</h2>
    <p>This Cookie Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in technology or law. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last Updated” date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Cookie Policy, please contact:</p>
